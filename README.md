# Grocery Planner

FastAPI in the back, Angular in the front, and a shared grocery list workflow tying it all together. Clone it, run the backend on port 8000, run the frontend on 4200, and you’re in business.

- Backend setup, API details, and scripts live in `backend/README.md`.
- Frontend notes, CLI commands, and styling info are in `grocery-frontend/README.md`.
- Architecture, rationale, and future work are collected under `docs/`.

That’s the tour—dive into the sub-folders when you’re ready for more.
